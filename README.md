# iframe-worker

A tiny [WebWorker] shim for `file://` in `690b` â€“ no dependencies.

---

Similar to [pseudo-worker], but using an `iframe` instead of
[`XMLHTTPRequest`][XMLHTTPRequest]. This shim should be mostly
spec-compliant and supports [`importScripts`][importScripts].

## Installation

``` sh
npm install iframe-worker
```

## Usage

You can use the shim from [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com) __(recommended)__:

``` html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/iframe-worker/shim"></script>
```

... or install and bundle the shim with your application:

``` js
import "iframe-worker/shim"
```

The shim will only mount if the document is served locally via `file://`. You
can also use `IFrameWorker` programmatically to customize the integration:

``` js
import { IFrameWorker } from "iframe-worker"
```

## Caveats

In a WebWorker script, [`importScripts`][importScripts] is a synchronous
operation, as it will block the thread until the script was fully loaded and 
evaluated. This is not supported in an `iframe`. For this reason, the shim for
[`importScripts`][importScripts] included with this library will return a 
`Promise`, chaining all passed URLs into a sequence, making it awaitable. 

Since awaiting anything else than a `Promise` will wrap the awaited thing into
a `Promise`, calls to [`importScripts`][importScripts] should practically behave
the same way for all protocols other than `file://`. Thus, if you want to make
sure that your WebWorker works for all protocols, always `await` all calls to 
[`importScripts`][importScripts].
